# WeGo
A UWP project developed for travelling（also for one of my college courses）. In this project, the photo album function requires a local web server. You can find it in the web.zip in the project.

 By the way, this photo album function and the local python server are developed by ZLQ <https://github.com/ffiirree>

Here is a list of the APIs we use.

* Bing Map <https://www.bingmapsportal.com/>

* Baidu Map <http://lbsyun.baidu.com/>

* WebXml Airline<http://ws.webxml.com.cn/webservices/DomesticAirline.asmx>

* YouDao Translation <http://fanyi.youdao.com/openapi>

* Ciba  <http://open.iciba.com/?c=api>

* HeFeng Weather <https://www.heweather.com/>

Thanks for the free services which they provide for personal developers.

The codes might be a little disorganized. But I'm too busy to put them in order recently. If you happened to see my codes,  please forgive me. I'm not a sloppy coders. Trust me.
